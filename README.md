# MNIST
The primary objective of this assignment is to develop and apply machine learning models to solve MNIST classification task:

A multi-label image-based digit classification.
These tasks are crucial in the field of machine learning, as they demonstrate the versatility of machine learning techniques in handling different types of data and solving real-world problems across various domains, such as finance, healthcare and computer vision.

Tasks
To effectively complete the assignment you must ensure that you complete the following tasks:

Load and preprocess the dataset for the classification problem (handle missing data, convert categorical features to numerical features).
Build a classifier for the classification problem using one of the specified models (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or artificial neural networks).
Fine-tune the selected model using appropriate techniques (eg, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, etc).
Visualise the dataset and / or the model's results, where applicable (eg, feature importance, confusion matrix, etc).
Report the final performance of the selected model using appropriate performance metrics (eg, accuracy, F1-score, etc).
Load and preprocess the dataset for the multi-label image-based digit classification problem (normalise pixel values, resize images if necessary, etc).
Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the multi-label image-based digit classification task.
Fine-tune the CNN model using appropriate techniques (eg, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, etc).
Visualise the dataset and / or the CNN model's results, where applicable (eg, feature maps, learning curves, etc).
Report the final performance of the CNN model using appropriate performance metrics (eg, accuracy, F1-score, etc).
Collaborate within the team and decide on the best model (for classification) and CNN architecture (for digit recognition).
Submit the code as Jupyter Notebooks.

Dataset:

It is a variant of the popular MNIST dataset, which is a collection of handwritten digits.
In the traditional MNIST dataset, each image contains a single handwritten digit ranging from 0 to 9. However, in this dataset, each image consists of three digits.
It introduces additional complexity and challenges for machine learning algorithms as It requires models to recognise and classify multiple digits within a single image.
The digits may be overlapping or partially obscured, making it more difficult for algorithms to accurately identify and classify each individual digit.
